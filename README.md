============

Hi, professor and TAs! I am Wenlin Huang. I am the CS Align student enrolled last fall.

I previously had a bit of development experience in Java/Ruby/Rails and jQuery/Bootstrap. But I never had any experience
with Single-page applications. I really look forward to completing this course and become a better web developer!
